The things that I did for this research are : 

1. Examined Knuth's NaturalMergeSort to enhance its performance.
2. Optimized the algorithm by accounting for both ascending and descending runs.
3. Implemented enhancements in C++, resulting in a remarkable 97.5% improvement in the worst-case scenario.
4. Conducted experiments on diverse datasets, demonstrating superiority over Knuth's NaturalMergeSort by 17.5% and traditional merge sort.
5. Presented findings graphically, showcasing the algorithm's efficiency among other sorting methods.
